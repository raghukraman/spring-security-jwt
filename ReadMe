This is a sample spring security project.

Authentication is done via using the UserDetailsServiceImpl(read Spring framework class : UserDetailsService), can be
done via database , but this hardcoded to foo/foo...

when you use the url endpoint , it will ask for a username and password.

Dependencies Required

1. JWS
2. Jaxb api = only required if you use java 9


Class
JWTUtil
  -> generate token from a given user details....
  -> extract username method : takes a token , return the username
  -> extract expiration method : takes a toen, whether the token is expired or not...
  -> validate token (extract username from token and compares with the username passed.

--Read the SecurityConfigurer which extends -- WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

Read the JWT Util Class..

It helps in 2 things.

1. generate JWT Token.
2. Extract the token and validate

Step 1: A / Authenticate an endpoint

-- Accepts User id and password
-- return the JWT Response

a. Create an Authentication Request in a models package.(java bean simply to put)
b. Create an Authentication Response in a model package.

JwtRequestFilter which extends OncePerRequestFilter

Step 2:

a. intercept all the incoming request
b. extract jwt from header
c. validate and set in execution context.

How to test ::::

Use post name and hit the http url - method : HttpMethod.POST and generate the token..
http://127.0.0.1:8201/authenticate/
Dont forget to use the "/" after authenticate in postman....
